For my Javascript/Rails project, I decided to make an app called "Wine & Dine" where you can find food and wine pairings.  I'm using Javascript for the front end to render objects to the DOM and Rails as an API where food, wine and pairing data can be accessed by the front end. 

I used an object oriented approach for building out my Javascript front end since we'll be dealing with this in the next and final React project. This was a bit tricky for me to grasp initially so I'm going to dive into it a bit here.
